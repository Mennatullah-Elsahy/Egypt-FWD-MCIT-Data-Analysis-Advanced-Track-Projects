# Analyze-AB-Test-Results
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that we get some practice working with the difficulties of these. For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Table of Contents
- Introduction
- Part I - Probability
- Part II - A/B Test
- Part III - Regression

## The goals are
- use A/B hypothesis testing in python to help the company find out whether the new website landing page has a higher users conversion rate than the old page using Pandas and Matplotlib. 
- perform regression analysis using two methods -- Using loop to simulate 10,000 experiments using NumPy.random.choice() function and another method to use the StatsModel package to run the logistic regression model.
